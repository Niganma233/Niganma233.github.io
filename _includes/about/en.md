# About Me
Hi, I'm WHY, currently a second-year high school student in Shenzhen. Through a chance encounter, I met onecreeper and used programming books he brought to the dormitory to learn some Python and Java (though I can only read simple code and have essentially no coding ability myself). Now I enjoy discovering fun projects on GitHub to deploy on my computer â€“ for instance, this blog was forked from @huxpro and deployed using GitHub Pages.

## Will This Blog Continue to Be Updated?
This mainly depends on whether I have time. If the curriculum in my third year of high school is not so heavy later on, I might share some projects I find on GitHub here.
